snake
=====
This is a basic snake game. The graphics are inspired by one of my person heroes, Kush Patel, who loves cats. The code is just about ready for two-player gameplay. There is no real back-end to this game. All of the data necessary for detecting collisions, placing cats (apples) and moving/growing the snake are stored on the DOM in data attributes and classes.
